A how to for adding repository keys

SSH (secure shell) is  one of the methods used to remotely access *nix computers and it is one of the options available from  most 
repostiory hosts to provide encryption. 

Symmetric key are used by SSH in order to encrypt the entire connection. The public/private key pairs that are generated by you are used 
for authentication (not encryption) The idea behind a public/private key encryption is that anyone with the public key can encrypt datat 
which can then ONLY be read by the person with the private key. So that is used for authentiction.
The key that is used to encrypt is created through an exchange betweent he client and server.  Both contribute to the creation of the 
unique secret key for the session.

To generate a key see [[instructions here]](keygen.md) 

When you generaded your key ssh-keygen created a directory structure as follows

Note: this will be in /h on the lab computers, it will be elsewhere on your home computer)

``` {.bash}
$ ls -l .ssh/
total 9
-rw-r--r-- 1 owner 197121 1679 Nov 29  2016 id_rsa
-rw-r--r-- 1 owner 197121  403 Nov 29  2016 id_rsa.pub
-rw-r--r-- 1 owner 197121 1163 Aug 11 17:04 known_hosts
```

Never share your private key (id_rsa) you need to get you public key into the clipboard as follows in git-bash:

``` {.bash}
cat ./ssh/id_rsa.pub | clip
```

Logon to your git repo server (github/gitlab etc) and follow the appropriate instructions
